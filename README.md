## how do i install this?

<p align="center"> <img width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehh0vcki/group-autoclaimer/main/images/install.png" alt="installation button"> </p>

to run this, you need to have:
- [python](https://python.org)
    - recommended to install 3.12.2; this auto was written on it!
- [git](https://git-scm.com)

after you install everything, extract zip of autoclaimer in any folder *(do not put spaces in folder name! replace them with <b>_</b> or <b>-</b>!)*, and run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## what should i change to set up autoclaimer?

in `files/settings.json` you need to change this:
```json
{
    "webhooks": [] <<-- this! add your webhooks
    "requirements": {} <<-- by choice of user. if any requirements will be meet, it will ping you. there only 4 modes: > < >= <=
    "token": "" <<-- and this, ofc
}
```
and in `files/cookies.txt` you should add your roblox cookie, also known as **.ROBLOSECURITY**.

colors settings are changing colors, that console shows to you. for example, when original color is red, new will be green. this is actually just to make console not look boring, and give some colors and new look to boring logs. heres table of default colors.
